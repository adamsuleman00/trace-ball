# Trace Ball

Trace ball is a game where the player controls a square cursor and their purpose is to avoid the enemy NPC (Non-Player Character) chasing them. The game is over once the NPC touches the playersâ€™ position three times. The player has the option of restarting the game. The aim is to stay alive as much as possible within the game canvas.
