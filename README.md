# I. Initiative

Trace ball is a game that consist of two squares, one is controlled by the players character and the other is controlled by the enemy NPC (Non-Player Character). The users aim is to stay alive and avoid the enemy NPC colliding with each other within the game canvas. The game is over once the NPC touches the playersâ€™ position three times. The player has the option of restarting the game. 

# II. Epics and User Stories

Epics
- The game will need to run in the square canvas. 
- The player must be able to move cursor to move player character.
- NPC chases the player cursor until they collide.
- The player must have three lives and has to avoid the enemy NPC.
- The two squares must be able to collide with each other.

User Stories
- As a player, I would like to see 2 squares and a canvas.
- As a player, I would like to move the my character with the mouse cursor.
- As a player, I would like to for the NPC square to follow my character.
- As a player, I would like for the squares to collide and result in game over.
- As a player, I would like to manoeuvre my character within the game canvas.
- As a player, I would like to restart the game, once my lives are gone.

Non-functional Requirements
- The players character colour should be green.
- The NPC character colour should be red.  
- The players character colour should be different from the enemy NPC, so it is easy to distinguish from each other.
- The player should have three lives.
- The player should get feedback once the two squares collide.
- Both squares should be the same size.

How We Addressed The Requirements
- 2 squares
- Game canvas

#### Programming Challenges
- This project started out in Notepad++, which made debugging and solving issues more difficult.
- Another issue was to program the enemy NPC to follow the players character. This took some time to solve the problem.
- Allow the player to have three lives to use up.
- Implement a restart button, once lives had reached zero.
